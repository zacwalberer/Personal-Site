		<h4>Background</h4>
		<p>The vision for Second Wave has been to create playful, beautiful, everyday lingerie that makes the wearer feel empowered. The brand was built on the mission to celebrate women and perfectly combine form and function into the design. The goal is to make the brand less of an enterprise and more “human.” The brand has to reflect a playful, tongue-in-cheek style; most lingerie brands are either too serious or not serious enough. The objective was to find a good medium while presenting itself as boldly as possible.</p>
		<h4	class="recent">Research</h4>
		<p>In our initial research we created user personas to target the needs of our visitors by asking staff at each congregation to interview their attendees on personal website use. We then used this feedback to assess previous pain points in our old website and structure our new layout. Here is a sitemap flow of the website.

		<h4>Design</h4>
		<p>Redemption Church partnered with Whiteboard to create the WordPress backend and to design the visual modules of the site (through the UX research and UI direction that we created). We implemented new Google Analytics tracking for each website, trained staff accordingly, created a database with AWS S3 servers, and created podcasts through FeedBurner and iTunes - which were based on the XML data from uploaded audio.</p>
		<p>The outcome was a beautifully designed site which used atomic design principles to create increased congruency within our current branding strategies. Mobile access increased by 20%, session duration increase by .5 seconds, and we saw bounce rate decrease as well. Through our communication on the website: new sessions have increased by 30% as we reach more users through other communication campaigns and initiatives. The sermon audio and video libraries have worked well and create a pain-free listening and viewing experience within the browser.</p>
