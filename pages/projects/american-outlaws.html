			<h4>Design</h4>
			<p>The brand identity for the Phoenix chapter needed a major reconstruction. This chapter is a part of the National American Outlaws Association, who is the official fan organization of the US Men's National Soccer Team. The goal was to create a simple visual identity which was centered around a new logo, and would be implemented on a scarf (because soccer fans love their scarves).</p>
			<p>The key elements to be implemented into the design were: the Arizona flag, American colors and iconic imagery, and a font that could be used along with the revamped identity.</p>
