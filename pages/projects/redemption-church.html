		<h4>Background</h4>
		<p>Redemption Church is a multi-congregational church with 10 locations throughout the state of Arizona. Eight in the Phoenix area, one in Tucson and one in Flagstaff.</p>
		<p>We had to come up with a solution in which we would have a homepage that represented Redemption Church as a whole, along with 10 subdomain sites for all of the congregations. Our goals were to create a site that would be responsive, give visitors a clear picture of Redemption Church wholistically, implement a beautiful viewing experience around our brand standards, and to create an audio and video sermon library that was easy to find and use.</p>
		<h4	class="recent">Research</h4>
		<p>In our initial research we created user personas to target the needs of our visitors by asking staff at each congregation to interview their attendees on personal website use. We then used this feedback to assess previous pain points in our old website and structure our new layout. Here is a sitemap flow of the website.

		<h4>Design</h4>
		<p>Redemption Church partnered with Whiteboard to create the WordPress backend and to design the visual modules of the site (through the UX research and UI direction that we created). We implemented new Google Analytics tracking for each website, trained staff accordingly, created a database with AWS S3 servers, and created podcasts through FeedBurner and iTunes - which were based on the XML data from uploaded audio.</p>
		<p>The outcome was a beautifully designed site which used atomic design principles to create increased congruency within our current branding strategies. Mobile access increased by 20%, session duration increase by .5 seconds, and we saw bounce rate decrease as well. Through our communication on the website: new sessions have increased by 30% as we reach more users through other communication campaigns and initiatives. The sermon audio and video libraries have worked well and create a pain-free listening and viewing experience within the browser.</p>
