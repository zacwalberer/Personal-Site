			<p class="recent">Surge Network exists to equip leaders in all fields and vocations to live as “sent people” to bless a broken world. The network was initially made up of 4 local churches in Phoenix. Surge is now made up of hundreds of pastors, and around 70 churches across Arizona who are involved in various aspects of the network.</p>
