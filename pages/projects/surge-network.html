			<h1>Surge Network</h1>
			<p class="recent">Surge Network exists to equip leaders in all fields and vocations to live as “sent people” to bless a broken world. The network was initially made up of 4 local churches in Phoenix. Surge is now made up of hundreds of pastors, and around 70 churches across Arizona who are involved in various aspects of the network.</p>

<h4>Design</h4>
<p>The Surge Network needed a rebrand and new responsive website for mobile viewing and content creation. The direction for the brand design was to be “organic” and “formative.” The green path-like nature of the design was meant to display this direction. We built off of Squarespace because additional sites would need to be created and managed through the CMS. We felt it was a CMS that could be easily adopted and used for different authors and users. There will be future work on the Surge Network’s theological school and seminary.</p>
