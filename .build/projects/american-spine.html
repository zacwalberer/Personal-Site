			<h4>Background</h4>
			<p>American Spine Group had issues on a local and mobile level with their conversion rate optimization. Through a website redesign we believed we could solve these issues. There were several other issues we came across when looking over their data and analytics. These changes would improve the overall site further and establish the brand in gaining more traffic digitally and locally.</p>
			<h4	class="margin-top">Goals</h4>
			<p>Our goals on this project were to create a website that would increase local, mobile and conversion rate optimization for their appointment requests. Our research on American Spine Group and their users helped inform how we would go about solving these issues throughout the design process and different phases of the build. Finally, we wanted to keep communication clear and upfront so that there would be no confusion and unmet expectations from either side.</p>
			<h4	class="margin-top">Research</h4>
			<p>For local engagement and optimization we wanted to relaunch their brand through the new website because of a recent name change. This change caused issues in their SEO and previous website meta data. Because search engines and local directories control this information, a continuous audit of the website and it’s traffic was needed to help inform future changes and decisions based on user information and searches.</p>
			<p>Their website received far more visits from mobile devices than desktop, but the user experience data did not match the expected outcome with their previous website. Rather, time on site was very low, and pages visited were minimal. Analyzing and evaluating the mobile
			experience for better outcomes was focused on.</p>
			<p>Conversion rate optimization also had some discrepancies. The number of users who completed the Request An Appointment form when compared to the number of local visits to the website was very different.</p>
			<p>After getting all of our goals set in place and the content from American Spine Group, we put together an outline of what was needed for the websites structure. This can be seen <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hdqvt4rcvjlvehm/PainMedGroup-%20Website%20Requirements.pdf?dl=0"	alt="american spine content" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			<p>There were low returning rates compared to new website visitor rates. Patients had nothing to return for, and were not being directed to the site for followup information. We decided a site update to all the imagery they use and a new blog would lay the initial groundwork for creating an environment in which patients are prompted to return to the site.</p>
			<h4	class="margin-top">Design</h4>
			<p>For local engagement and optimization we wanted to relaunch their brand through the new website because of a recent name change. This change caused issues in their SEO and previous website meta data. Because search engines and local directories control this information, a continuous audit of the website and it’s traffic was needed to help inform future changes and decisions based on user information and searches.</p>
			<p>The Request Appointment button did not convert users to appointments very well at all. The solution we created was to update this call to action and bring more attention to it on the page and throughout the website.</p>
			<p>Content creation was a large part of their strategy to gain more user engagement throughout their site. Going through this content and helping them come up with a plan was something we did early and often throughout the project. Their blogs had become outdated and were not updated very often. Our solution was to create a content audit and while we helped rewrite a large portion of their content. We then created a blog for them to publish from and categorize their content correctly.</p>
			<p>Their site performed very poorly in time spent on the site through mobile devices. Mobile counted for more than half their traffic, so this was a huge priority and opportunity to design a well thought out mobile experience. We analyzed and evaluated their mobile user experience and came to the conclusion that mobile navigation needed to be easy to use and flow through.</p>
			<p>The technical SEO needed some updating. We went through and made sure the internal structure of the site was updated throughout the build process. Working with the SEO team we also updated the meta tags and titles throughout the html structure to better target their brand and keep this in sync with their name change. This was something we felt we had to test and revisit in the coming months to make sure it was all working properly and up to their desired needs.</p>
			<p>The American Spine Group website had three major audiences - referring physicians, patients, and staff. Patients could be further split into three categories: new patients, current patients, and family members of patients—all three had the same overall goals as the patient audience, but with additional goals dependent upon further classification. Through the design of the site and page structures, we created easy ways for all types of users to get information about the practice, it’s medical professionals and the locations they practice at.</p>
			<p>Here are some wireframes of this process:</p>

			<h4>Outcome</h4>
			<p>After the launch of the website we saw very positive growth in all the areas we looked to improve. Local searches and mobile use increased with very positive flows throughout the site. American Spine Group saw greater conversion rates on their new patient appointments through the website, which they were very pleased with.</p>
